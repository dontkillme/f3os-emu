Application/applet in JAVA that looks like operating system from fallout third/nv.
Allows to use your own text and images. Mainly for LARPs and Post-apo stuff.
You can use it online as java applet or as desktop application. Uses the same config file for both.<br>
Application includes:<br>
- plain text printed to screen or text with images<br>
- text and images with auto rescale and recolor to green scale (from 2.0 use can set the color scale)<br>
- hacking like in fallout,<br>
- interactive story (like the interactive adventure books) (not in 2.0)<br>
