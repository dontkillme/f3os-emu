Welcome to admin mode help! There are several things
you can change in this mode. For this moment this is the list
of working commands:

#adminshow - shows console properties in text mode

#adminpanel - runs gui for console properties with possibility of changes
remember that not all options are here. Some cant be changed during the 
operation of program, other are not here cause im too lazy :P

#bypass - if active, console will ignore hack mode and open files like the ones without hack parameter.

to exit admin mode use:
#papa
#exit admin mode
